              <p>Since the mid 2000s, promoters of pole dance fitness competitions have been trying to change peoples¡¯ perception of pole dance and to promote it as a non-sexual form of dance and acrobatics.

             Pole dance requires significant strength, flexibility and endurance. Pole dance proper involves athletic moves such as climbs, spins, and body inversions using the limbs to grip. Upper body and core strength are required to attain proficiency, and rigorous training is necessary.

            Pole dance is now regarded as a form of exercise which can be used as both an aerobic and anaerobic workout. Recognized schools and qualifications are now commonplace</p>

             <li><img src="stretch.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">
			    <p>Stretching exercises encourage lengthening of your muscles and their associated tendons. 
                They counteract the shortening and tightening of muscles that can occur immediately after vigorous exercise, and as a product of ageing and inactivity. 
                A sedentary lifestyle that involves long periods of sitting or driving can cause your muscles to shorten and tighten. This reduces your range of motion and can lead to stiffness and pain.</p>
